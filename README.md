# Car Data Analysis Documentation üìù

## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview and explanation of a Streamlit application designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of automotive dataset. The application aims to assist users in making informed decisions regarding car purchases by providing insights and visualizations based on various car metrics and features.

### Purpose
The purpose of the application is to offer users a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze automotive data, including sales distribution, trends, horsepower analysis, fuel efficiency, and more. By interacting with the application, users can gain insights into different aspects of car data, aiding them in selecting the ideal vehicle based on their preferences.

### Features
- **Data Visualization**: The application provides interactive visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, line plots, and histograms to represent different aspects of the automotive dataset.
- **User Preferences**: Users can specify their preferences for acceleration, top speed, weight, and load using range input fields. The application filters the dataset based on these preferences and displays relevant information.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the user's preferences, the application offers recommendations for cars that match the specified criteria, considering factors like price and fuel efficiency.

## Code Overview
The code for the Streamlit application consists of two main sections: data cleaning and the Streamlit application itself. Below is an overview of each section:

### Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process involves several steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. These steps include:
1. Importing necessary libraries and the dataset.
2. Handling missing values by filling or dropping them based on the context.
3. Correcting data types of certain columns.
4. Removing duplicate rows and ensuring data integrity.

### Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application is divided into several sections, each corresponding to a specific aspect of data analysis. Here are the main components of the application:
- **Sidebar**: Allows users to select different analysis questions and specify their preferences for car features.
- **Data Analysis**: Based on the selected question, the application displays relevant visualizations and insights, such as sales distribution, trends, top models by horsepower, and more.
- **User Preferences**: Displays user-selected preferences and filters the dataset accordingly to provide personalized recommendations.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents visualizations based on the filtered dataset, including scatter plots and recommendations.
- **About Section**: Provides information about the purpose and functionality of the application.

## Conclusion
The Car Data Analysis Streamlit application serves as a valuable tool for exploring and analyzing automotive data. By leveraging interactive visualizations and user input, the application empowers users to make informed decisions when purchasing a car.
